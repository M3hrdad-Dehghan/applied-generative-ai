## 🧠 Business Problem

Traditional keyword-based search systems often fail to capture user intent and semantic meaning, leading to irrelevant or incomplete search results. 

---

## 🎯 Objective 

The objective of this project was to build an AI-powered semantic search solution that understands contextual meaning and retrieves the most relevant information from unstructured text using embedding-based similarity.

---

## 📊 Data & Inputs

- Unstructured textual content used as the search corpus
- Real user search queries for semantic retrieval
- High-dimensional vector embeddings generated from text using Vertex AI Embeddings

---

## ⚙️ Technical Approach

- Generated dense text embeddings using Vertex AI, transforming unstructured text into high-dimensional vector representations
- Designed and implemented vector indexing and similarity search to enable efficient nearest-neighbor retrieval
- Built an end-to-end semantic retrieval workflow that compares query embeddings against indexed vectors to return contextually relevant results
- Optimized retrieval logic to significantly improve relevance over traditional keyword-based search

---

## 🛠 Key Skills Demonstrated

- Semantic search and information retrieval
- Embeddings, vector similarity, and nearest-neighbor search
- Generative AI foundations and LLM-related workflows
- Cloud-native AI services (Vertex AI)
- End-to-end GenAI application design
